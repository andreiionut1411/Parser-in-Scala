# Parser-in-Scala

This is a Parser written in Scala for the Formal Languages and Automata
course. The project was separated in 3 parts:

1) Implement an algorithm for the Prenex to NFA transformation, and for the
NFA to DFA transformation.

2) Implement the Shunting Yard Algorithm to transfor a Prenex to a Regex

3) Implement the parser using the above pieces and create a configuration
for a simple programming language
